# My C++ Projects

Welcome to my repository of C++ projects! This repository contains five different projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects and concepts of C++, demonstrating my progression and skills in the language. Below you will find a brief overview of each project. For a more detailed explanation, including the concepts used and what each project entails, please refer to the individual README.md file within each project's directory.

## 1. [Dynamic Array](./Task1_DynamicArray)

In this project, I implemented a dynamic array. Dynamic arrays are a fundamental concept, allowing arrays to be resized during runtime. Visit the project to see how memory allocation, reallocation, and other essential operations are handled.

## 2. [War Card Game](./WarCardGame)

This project simulates the classic War card game. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, including classes and objects, to handle cards and players.

## 3. [Fraction](./Fraction)

Here, I worked with fractions, implementing mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project showcases operator overloading and other C++ features.

## 4. [Cowboy vs. Ninja Game](./CowboyVsNinja)

This project is a game where a cowboy faces off against a ninja. It is a simple simulation that uses various C++ concepts to create an engaging text-based game.

## 5. [Magical Iterator](./MagicalIterator)

In this last project, a magical iterator is implemented. The iterator traverses containers in unique ways, demonstrating advanced C++ topics like iterators and operator overloading.
