# ADT - General Dynamic Array in C

In this assignment, a general dynamic array in the C language has been implemented. A dynamic array is an array that changes its size so that any non-negative index access is valid. When accessing an index where no value has been set, it returns NULL.

## Examples

To understand how the program is expected to work, you can refer to the examples in the file:
[Demo.c](Demo.c)

To test the program, run the following commands to ensure they execute without compile errors, runtime issues, or memory leaks:

<div dir='ltr'>

    make demo
    make run
    make mem_test

</div>

</div>
